    Hi, I’m Prashant Shrestha, a passionate web developer who enjoys turning ideas into clean, functional, and visually engaging digital experiences. I love exploring the endless possibilities of the web — whether it’s building responsive user interfaces, optimizing performance, or experimenting with new technologies that push creativity further.
<br />
<br />
What drives me most is the process of learning itself. I’m always curious to understand how things work and constantly challenge myself to grow — one line of code, one concept, and one project at a time. For me, web development isn’t just about writing code; it’s about solving problems, crafting experiences, and continuously evolving along with the ever-changing tech landscape.
<br />
<br />
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me experimenting with new tools, refining my skills, or working on side projects that help me think differently. My goal is simple — to keep learning, keep building, and keep creating something meaningful every day.
